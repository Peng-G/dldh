# Deep Learning and Digital Humanities (DLDH), 2020

## Organization

Two video lectures, introducing Deep Learning and Digital Humanities, will be available by the end of November. One zoom session will be held in the first week of December to discuss topics and further organization.

The students will present their topics in three sessions in January. Students have to upload videos which will be discussed in the January sessions. More infos to come.

The seminar will cover 8-10 topics. Depending on the number of participants, we will allow multiple students per topics (e.g., 1-3). 

The seminar will be held by [Steffen Eger](https://steffeneger.github.io/) and [Thomas Haider](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/institut/mitarbeiterinnen/thomas-haider.html)
