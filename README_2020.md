## Organization

Two video lectures, introducing Deep Learning and Digital Humanities, will be available by the end of November. One zoom session will be held in the first week of December to discuss topics and further organization.

The students will present their topics in three sessions in January. Students have to upload videos which will be discussed in the January sessions. More infos to come.
