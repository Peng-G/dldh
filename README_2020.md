# Deep Learning and Digital Humanities (DLDH), 2020

## Organization

Two video lectures, introducing Deep Learning and Digital Humanities, will be available by the end of November. One zoom session will be held in the first week of December to discuss topics and further organization.

The students will present their topics in three sessions in January. Students have to upload videos which will be discussed in the January sessions. More infos to come.

The seminar will cover 8-10 topics. Depending on the number of participants, we will allow multiple students per topics (e.g., 1-3). 

The seminar will be held by [Steffen Eger](https://steffeneger.github.io/) and [Thomas Haider](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/institut/mitarbeiterinnen/thomas-haider.html)

### Meetings
There will be one meeting in early December (most likely: Thursday December 3, e.g., 16-17) to discuss topics and organizatinal issues.

There will be three seminar sessions in January where students present their topics (3min) and answer questions. Students also need to upload videos prior to the seminar sessions.

### Language
The seminar will be held in English.

### Topics

We will offer 9-10 topics:

- Emotion detection & analysis
- Metaphor detection & analysis 
- Poetry generation & analysis
- Art
- Fiction & Narration
- Semantic Change
- Corpora & Annotation
- Spelling normalization & OCR
- Stylometry
- Analysis of scientific texts

Each topic will be assigned 1 to 4 students, who jointly need to present it. **Note that groups of 3 or more students need to conduct an own experiment which needs to be discussed in their term paper**
