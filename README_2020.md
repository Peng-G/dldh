# Deep Learning and Digital Humanities (DLDH), 2020

## Organization

The seminar is held by [Steffen Eger](https://steffeneger.github.io/) and [Thomas Haider](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/institut/mitarbeiterinnen/thomas-haider.html).

The seminar will cover 8-10 topics. Depending on the number of participants, we will allow multiple students per topics (e.g., 1-4). 

### Meetings
There will be one meeting in early December (Thursday December 3, 16-17) to discuss topics and organizational issues.

There will be three seminar sessions in January where students present their topics (3min) and answer questions (about 10min per group member). Students also need to upload videos prior to the seminar sessions. Videos should be ~15min per student, i.e., total length will be 15-60min.

### Language
The seminar will be held in English.

### Contact

seminar.dldh@gmail.com

### Video lectures

We provide two lectures, one introducing the syllabus and the field of Digitial Humanities; it is available here: 

  - [A Quick Introduction to Digital Humanities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2tmBpOoaEM). 
    
The other video introduces Deep Learning, and is split in three parts: 
  
  - [Basics and History](https://youtu.be/jWi3BG0t8PM), 
  - [Input Representations](https://youtu.be/RT8M6pR_IQM), 
  - [Architectures](https://youtu.be/xovnSOUFGdg). 


### Seminar sessions

 - Session 1, Thursday, 21.01.2021 (16-18:30)
 - Session 2, Thursday, 28.01.2021 (16-18:30)
 - Session 3, Thursday, 04.02.2021 (16-18:30)

### Topics

We will offer 8-10 topics among the following:

- Corpora & Annotation
- Spelling normalization & OCR
- Emotion detection & analysis
- Metaphor detection & analysis 
- Semantic Change
- Stylometry
- Fiction & Narration
- Poetry, Arts & Music: Generation & Analysis
- Ethics & Bias
- Explainability and Interpretability
- Analysis of scientific texts



Each topic will be assigned 1 to 4 students, who will present it jointly. **Note that groups of 3 or more students must conduct an own experiment to be discussed in their term papers** (this is relevant only for the term papers).
